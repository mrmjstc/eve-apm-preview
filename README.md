# EVE-APM Preview

## What is EVE-APM Preview?

EVE-APM Preview creates small thumbnail previews of all your EVE Online client windows, making it easy to monitor and switch between multiple characters at a glance. Whether you're multiboxing, managing an alt fleet, or just keeping an eye on multiple characters, this tool streamlines your workflow.

## What EVE-APM Preview Isn't

It's **never** going to let you input broadcast, display portions of your eve client, manipulate your eve client in any way or intentionally help you break the EVE Online EULA/TOS. 

## Why not just use EVE-O/X Preview?

Choice! You should use whatever you prefer and suits your needs, I designed this around ease-of-setup. No need to edit configuration files when you can do it all from a configuration interface!

## Key Features

### Window Management
- **Live Thumbnails** - See real-time previews of all your EVE Online windows in one place

## Credits

This is a C++ Qt reimplementation, and heavily inspired by the original EVE-O Preview and EVE-X Preview tools for EVE Online players. It wouldn't exist if not for the excellent work of those developers that came before me.
